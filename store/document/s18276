The department was renamed &quot;Department of Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering &quot; in 1987 with the transfer of the institute to &quot;Beijing Agricultural Engineering University&quot;. The &quot;College of Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering&quot; was instituted in 1995 with the merging of former Beijing Agricultural Engineering University and Beijing Agricultural University to China Agricultural University (CAU). The college is located on the east campus of CAU. With graceful environment and convenient transportation, the campus is situated on the famous College Road in Beijing. A modern Olympic gymnasium is being constructed on the campus. The college consists of four departments as follows: Department of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, Department of Agricultural Structure &amp; Bioenvironmental Engineering, Department of Fluid Engineering &amp; Fluid Machinery, Department of Civil Engineering. The college offers 5 undergraduate programs leading to the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E) degree. They are Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, Agricultural Structure Environment &amp; Energy Engineering, Fluid Machinery and Fluid Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Hydraulic and Hydropower Engineering. Six graduate programs leading to the Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E) degree are offered in the fields of Agri-biological Environmental &amp; Energy Engineering, Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering, Conservancy of Water and Soil, Fluid Machinery and Engineering, Hydrology and Water Resource, and Civil Engineering. The programs for PhD are Agri-biological Environmental &amp; Energy Engineering, and Agricultural Soil &amp; Water Engineering. The discipline of Agri-biological Environmental &amp; Energy Engineering is the key discipline of Ministry of Agriculture, and also the provincial key discipline of Beijing. In addition to these disciplines, there are three disciplines shared with other colleges. The college offers undergraduate programs and graduate programs for adult education too. The total number of undergraduates and graduate students registered in the college comes to 1493 in the college.. Now the college has 82 faculty and staff, of whom 1 has been appointed as Changjiang Scholar by Ministry of Education, 12 are professors, 32 are associate professors. Half of the staff have got the PhD degree. There are 41 supervisors for graduate students in the college, among whom 12 are supervisors for Ph.D students. The newly constructed college building was completed in 2002 with an aera of 7000 m2. The building is equipped with advanced instruments and facilities. Many public laboratories have been established in and outside the building, for example, Laboratory of Soil and Water Engineering, Agri-biological Environmental Engineering, Architectural Engineering in Agriculture, Rural Energy Engineering, Civil Engineering, Fluid Machinery and Fluid Engineering. Some other experimental stations were established outside the campus. The Key Laboratory of Agricultural Bio-Environment Engineering of Ministry of Agriculture was set up in 1993 in the college. The Center of Agricultural Water Research in China was set up in 2003 in the college, and the main task of the Center is undertaken by the academic researchers of the college. The college has other six research centers and institutions. About 5,000 students have graduated from the college including some VIPs in relative fields such as the former Minister of Water Resources in China, President of HeBei Province. The college has carried on several hundred of research projects such as National Great Basic Research Program (973 project), National 863 High Technology Development Plan Project, National Nature Scientific Fund project since 1980s. A number of scientific and research achievements have reached advanced level both at home and abroad. Over 60 achievements have been awarded the national or provincial prizes. In 2002 only, the total contractual research funds were 5,750,000 RMB, and the instrument funds were up to more than 7,600,000 RMB. 109 academic papers were published in national and international journals. As a key University in China, CAU is developing rapidly. The college is also stepping into a fast development period. @ CopyRight By 中国农业大学 水利与土木工程学院 地址：北京市海淀区清华东路17号 邮编：100083 电话：010-62736533</content></html>
